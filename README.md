# Build a jenkins-debian-glue Box
This is just a simple setup to build a [jenkins-debian-glue](http://jenkins-debian-glue.org) Ubuntu box for
first tests.

As I am automation obsessed, I prefer 

```
vagrant up
```

to do things. Then I have documented what should be done to get
a box with the software in it.
